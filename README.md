# Hector-sChallenge1
This will host the first challenge in the bootcamp. 
This was an example of an asset project given in what I understand to be a web developers daily task. Given a html, css and other files that need to be
improved. In this case it was a simple html and css file that we were to refactor. Initially it only had div, img, h1-h2 and p tags. After refactoring 
it has a header, footer, multiple figure tabs along with nav and sections to be able to more easily navigate it in the developer tools on a browser.
